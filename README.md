Image Classification Task on Fashion-MNIST Dataset with Machine Learning Algorithms

In this project, Machine Learning approach was used on a dataset of images, which were processed to make accurate predictions. The problem was the classification of cloth images; therefore the purpose was correctly predicting the classes of the images outside of the training set. Since there were 10 classes for the items to label each, it was a multiclass classification problem. The study was important to see and compare how different models (parametric and non-parametric) worked on the same dataset. Different algorithms (models) were employed to achieve this goal, learned in the scope of the course. Neural Network, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were run on the dataset, accuracy was measured, the predictions were evaluated and finally, some visualization tools were used to understand how the parameters changed for each model.
The best results were obtained by the Neural Network approach (88.1 %) even though all the algorithms had close accuracy values (between 80% and 90%).
